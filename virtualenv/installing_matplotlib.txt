Beforehand, need to install:
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev

if that doesn't work then execute:
sudo apt-get build-dep matplotlib, then do pip install matplotlib

if that still don't work, then download the source tar file, unzip, 
then do python setup.py build
then python setup.py install
