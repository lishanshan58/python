I found http://old.nabble.com/Windows:-virtualenv-and-pywin32--td27658201.html which offered the following solution, which worked for me:

Download the latest pywin32 .exe installer from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ 
Activate your virtualenv
Run easy_install blah.exe where the path matches your downloaded file 
A similar solution from the same page is:

Get the URL of the exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ 
Activate your virtualenv
Run easy_install http://path.to/.exe/download 
I originally got this error for the second solution:

error: c:\users\blah\appdata\local\temp\easy_install-ibkzv7\pywin32-214.win32-py2.6.exe is not a valid distutils Windows .exe

...but tovmeod reports in the comments that it is now working with modern versions of setuptools (circa February 2014). If it doesn't work for you, try the first method instead.

I rather hopefully tried "pip install" rather than "easy_install", but this didn't work.

Finally, I found but haven't tested the solution at http://www.mail-archive.com/python-list@python.org/msg272040.html which is:

Solved this by copying the pywin32.pth file into my virtualenv site-packages and editing the file to point to the path.




URL to pywin32.exe:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/pywin32-219.win32-py3.3.exe/download
