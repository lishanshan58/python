input_file = open(r'D:\tomcat\webapps\DensoOBD\files\BatteryTesterCodes\CreateBattFlatFileScript.txt')
output_file = open(r'D:\tomcat\webapps\DensoOBD\files\BatteryTesterCodes\target_file.txt','w')

for line in input_file:
  line = line.strip()+'MARKER'
  output_file.write(line)

input_file.close()
output_file.close()

Alternate method (useful if you need to treat the 1st line differently than the rest of the lines):
# Read the 1st row
first_row = input_file.readline().strip()

# Read the rest of the rows:
while input_file:
    line = input_file.readline().strip()
    if line == "":
        break
    else:
        # Do something...

input_file.close()
output_file.close()

Another method:
with open(...) as f:
    for line in f:
        <do something with line>

if you need to read just the first 5 rows of the text:
fp = open(r'path_to_your_file')
row_list = []
for i, line in enumerate(fp):
    if i < 5:
        row_list.append(line)
    else:
        break
fp.close()
