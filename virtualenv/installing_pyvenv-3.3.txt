####  As of Python version 3.3, pyvenv does not install pip, Python version 3.4 will  ####

To create new virtual environment, enter following command at terminal:
pyvenv-3.3 /path/to/environment

And then to activate it:
source /path/to/environment/bin/activate

To add to the above, and as per docs:
For example, after executing: pyvenv-3.3 /path/to/my_project/venv
You can run distribute_setup.py, which seems to do various things, but essentially you end up with easy_install in your ./my_project/venv/bin directory.
This can then be used to install pip and the like.

It does not say where you should get distribute_setup.py from, so I downloaded from:

http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
and using the activated environment:

cd /path/to/my_project
source venv/bin/activate
then execute:
python distribute_setup.py

then do:
easy_install pip

then do:
pip -V to confirm which pip the virtual environment is using.  If not the correct one, then try:
pip-3.3 or whatever is in the /bin folder
